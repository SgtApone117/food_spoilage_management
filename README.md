# food_spoilage_management
Fresh food app stages:

1) Take a picture of the product

2) Then the app suppose to detect if the product is food or not 

3) If it is food, we present the user with what product is on the picture

4) The app goes into a python script that gets the approximate expiration range

5) We send that to backend

6) Backend calculates the date the product will expire 

7) Present that date on main screen
