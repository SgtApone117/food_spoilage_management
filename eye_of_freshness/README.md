# eye_of_freshness

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


Steps:
You need to train a product classification model that can recognize different products from images. This model should identify the product based on visual characteristics like packaging, brand logos, etc.

If you don’t have a dataset, you might have to collect images of products you want the AI to recognize and categorize them. Platforms like Labelbox can help you manage and annotate the dataset.

After recognizing the product, the system will need a database or knowledge base that contains the typical shelf life of each product type. This could be a simple lookup table or a more complex system where each product has a predefined expiration duration (e.g., "Milk: 7 days," "Bread: 3 days").

Once the product is identified, the AI can calculate the expiration date based on the current date plus the typical shelf life (retrieved from your database).

You can fine-tune a pre-trained image classification model on your specific product dataset using frameworks like Keras or PyTorch. You’ll need to split the dataset into training and validation sets to ensure your model generalizes well.

Clarifai or IBM Watson may also provide tools for custom model training if you don’t want to develop the entire model pipeline from scratch.







Technology Stack:
Image Classification:

Use TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch for training a product classification model.
Pre-trained models like ResNet, Inception, or EfficientNet can speed up the development process via transfer learning.
Database for Expiration Dates:

Use a simple SQL database (e.g., SQLite or MySQL) to store products and their associated shelf life.
You can also use NoSQL databases like MongoDB if you prefer flexible data structures.
Backend for Date Calculation:

After identifying the product, a backend service (e.g., built with FastAPI or Flask) can calculate the expiration date using Python's datetime library.





Example Workflow:
Input: User uploads an image of a product (e.g., a carton of milk).
Step 1: The image classification model identifies the product (e.g., "Milk, Brand A").
Step 2: The system looks up the typical expiration date for the product (e.g., "Milk, Brand A" usually expires in 7 days).
Step 3: The system calculates the expiration date based on today's date (e.g., today is October 18, so expiration is October 25).
Output: The system returns "This product typically expires on October 25, 2024."



Tools to Consider:
Image Classification:

TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training the classification model.
Pre-trained models like EfficientNet or MobileNetV2 for fine-tuning.
Data Management:

SQL databases for storing product information and expiration times.
NoSQL solutions if flexibility in data storage is required.
Backend Framework:

FastAPI or Flask for creating the API that handles image uploads and processes expiration date calculations.
